            <h2 class="mb-4 text-4xl md:text-5xl font-heading font-bold"> Our Mission Statement </h2>
            <p class="mb-9 text-xl md:text-2xl font-heading font-medium text-gray-500"> It is our desire to
                create a welcoming environment that fosters community. We believe that conversation is king,
                music is its queen and that haircuts allow us to do this. Cutting hair is NOT the most
                important thing we do. We want women to always feel welcome and never quite
                comfortable. </p>
            <p class="mb-9 text-xl md:text-2xl font-heading font-medium text-gray-500"> Each of us hope you
                have a favorite barber, and even better if they work here. Kids and Dogs are allowed to be
                kids and dogs. If that is a problem, then this is not the place for you. If it gets really
                busy, we will crank the volume of the music. If the music is too loud to speak, it means we
                are having a great day. </p></div>
